## Overview

The **Referral Center** creates a streamlined digital pathway for transferring patients between departments or external facilities. It replaces paper referral slips with tracked, digital requests.

### Creating a Referral

1. Navigate to **Referral Center**.
2. Click **"New Referral"**.
3. Select the patient and the target department (e.g., _Radiology_, _External Specialist_).
4. Add clinical notes and urgency level (_Routine_ vs. _Stat_).

### Managing Requests

- **Incoming:** View patients referred _to_ your department. Click "Accept" to add them to your active queue.
- **Outgoing:** Track the status of patients you have sent elsewhere.
