## Overview

The **Bed Management** module provides a real-time visual map of hospital occupancy. It allows the Command Center to track bed availability across different wards (ER, ICU, General Ward) and manage patient admissions effectively.

### Dashboard Metrics

At the top of the dashboard, you will see key operational metrics:

- **Total Occupancy:** The percentage of beds currently in use.
- **Available Beds:** Net count of free beds ready for admission.
- **Pending Discharges:** Patients flagged for release within the next 4 hours.

## Managing Beds

### Assigning a Patient

1. Navigate to the **"Bed Management"** tab.
2. Click on a **"Vacant"** bed card (indicated in Green).
3. Search for the patient by name or scan their ID.
4. Confirm the assignment to update the status to **"Occupied"** (Red).

### Discharging a Patient

When a patient is cleared for discharge:

1. Select the occupied bed.
2. Click the **"Discharge"** button.
3. The bed status will temporarily switch to **"Cleaning"** (Yellow) before becoming **"Vacant"** again.

  **Pro Tip:** Use the "Ward Filter" dropdown to isolate specific areas like the
  ICU or Isolation Wing during high-traffic periods.
