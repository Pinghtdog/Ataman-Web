## Managing Services

This module acts as the directory for the entire ATAMAN system. It controls what options appear in the booking kiosks and patient apps.

### Adding a Service Unit

1. Click **"Add Service"**.
2. Define the **Unit Name** (e.g., "X-Ray Room 1").
3. Set **Operational Status** (Active/Maintenance).
4. Assign **Staff** authorized to operate this unit.

<Warning>
  Disabling a service here will immediately prevent new bookings for that unit
  across the entire hospital network.
</Warning>
