## The Patient Archive

This module serves as the long-term storage for all patient data. Unlike the active **Doctor Console**, this view is read-only and historical.

### Searching Records

You can locate a patient file using:

- **Medical ID** (Unique Hospital Number)
- **PhilHealth ID**
- **Full Name & Birthdate**

### File Contents

Each record contains:

1. **Clinical History:** Past diagnoses and treatments.
2. **Lab Results:** PDF attachments of blood work and imaging.
3. **Encounters:** Timeline of all previous hospital visits.
