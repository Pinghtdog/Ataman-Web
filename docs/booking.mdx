## Purpose

While many patients book via the app, the **Assisted Booking** module allows front-desk staff to schedule appointments for walk-in patients or those without smartphone access.

### Workflow

1. **Verify Identity:** Search if the patient already exists in the system.
2. **Select Slot:** Choose a department and view available time slots.
3. **Confirm:** The system will print a **Queue Ticket** with a QR code for the patient to hold.

<Note>
  Bookings made here instantly reflect on the Doctor's **Live Queue**.
