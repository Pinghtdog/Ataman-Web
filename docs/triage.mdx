## Role of the BHW

Barangay Health Workers (BHW) are the first point of contact. Your goal is to accurately record patient vital signs so the doctor has a complete picture before the consultation begins.

### Recording Vitals

When a patient arrives at the kiosk or desk:

1. **Scan ID:** Use the QR scanner to pull up the patient's existing record.
2. **New Entry:** If the patient is new, select **"Register New Patient"**.
3. **Input Fields:**
