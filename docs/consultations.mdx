## The Workflow

### 1. Patient Selection

Patients appear in the **"Upcoming Schedule"** list automatically once triaged by a BHW.

- Click **"Locate"** to search for a specific patient by name or ID.
- Use the **Scanner** button to scan a patient's ID card directly.

### 2. Clinical Workspace

Once a patient is selected, the interface splits into two panels:

| Panel           | Function                                                                                           |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Left Panel**  | Displays patient demographics (Age, Sex, PhilHealth Status) and **Vitals** recorded during triage. |
| **Right Panel** | The **Clinical Decision** form. Enter the _Diagnosis_, _Lab Findings_, and _Treatment Plan_ here.  |

<Warning>
  **Important:** You must enter a **Diagnosis** before the "Save & Close" button
  becomes active.
</Warning>

### 3. Verification

The console automatically checks the patient's **PhilHealth Status** and displays a verification badge next to their profile photo.
